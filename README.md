**THESE ICONS ARE 16x16. IT IS HEAVILY ADVISED THAT YOU CHANGE THE ZOOM (USUALLY IT IS ZOOM IN)SO IT DOESNT LOOK BLURRY.**

## Rights

Many of these icons are based off of the work of Microsoft™ (Mojang Studios™), Oracle™, Google™, Apple™, Winrar, and the Material icon theme. 
However, they are all modified under fair use.
